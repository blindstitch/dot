 Things I want

 changes i need to make to the syntax highlighting:
  - coloring for tags is terrible as always. make the colors unchanging, use dark for
    currently selected, lighter shade for the other side, or green, something unused. 
    red conflicts too much with the color used for characters presently.
 tex:
  - X wrapping is very broken for figures % I have installed a text wrapping perl program and put it in the keymaps. Jankily written but it works

 keymaps:
  - changing word with cw, dw, should always behave as caw, daw - there's ce and de for the other cases
  - c-w should not delete separator characters, it should behave more like daw.
  - sentence movement needs fixing, there's an error with how parens are mapped.

notes for a baby
 - packer plugins must be installed with PackerInstall
 - packer is installed with code in plugins.lua
 - must be updated with PackerUpdate
 - you can do subfolders and reference htem with dot notation - ex: 'lua/user/foo.nvim' is 'require('user.foo')
